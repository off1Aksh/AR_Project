# 🦴 AR Screaming Skeleton - Unity Project

This is a Unity-based Augmented Reality (AR) application developed for a final project assignment. The project features an animated skeleton character that users can interact with through rotation, audio, and informational UI.

## 📱 Features

- 🦴 **3D Skeleton Model**  
  A realistic skeleton that can be rotated using on-screen controls.

- 🔁 **Rotation Buttons**  
  Left and right buttons allow users to rotate the skeleton to observe it from different angles.

- ℹ️ **Info Button**

- 🔊 **Directional Audio**  
  The skeleton emits a scream sound that follows its rotation — sound pans to the left or right depending on its facing direction, enhancing the immersive AR experience.
